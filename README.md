# Time-Series-Analysis
Project Title: Time Series Analysis and Stock Price Prediction of Apple Inc. using Random Forest Classifier
# Introduction
In this time series analysis project, we will explore and predict the stock prices of Apple Inc. (AAPL) using historical stock price data. We will utilize Python for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis. The primary focus will be on applying a Random Forest Classifier model to predict future stock prices based on historical patterns and market variables.

# Dataset Description
The dataset used for this project consists of historical daily stock price data for Apple Inc. The dataset typically includes columns such as:
Date: The date of the stock price record.
Open: The opening price of AAPL stock on that day.
High: The highest price during the trading day.
Low: The lowest price during the trading day.
Close: The closing price of AAPL stock on that day.
Volume: The trading volume (number of shares traded) on that day.
Objectives
Data Collection and Preparation: Gather historical stock price data for Apple Inc. from a reliable source and prepare the dataset for analysis.
 

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct EDA to understand the basic statistics, trends, and patterns in the historical stock price data. Visualize the data to gain insights.
Feature Engineering: Create relevant features from the historical data that can be used for time series forecasting, such as moving averages, relative strength indicators, and more.
Data Splitting: Split the dataset into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the Random Forest Classifier model.
Model Building: Build a Random Forest Classifier model that uses historical stock price data and engineered features to predict whether the stock price will increase or decrease in the future.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Fine-tune the model if necessary.
Stock Price Prediction: Apply the trained model to predict future stock prices of Apple Inc.
Visualization: Visualize the predicted stock prices alongside actual prices to assess the model's accuracy and performance.
 

Conclusion and Recommendations: Summarize the findings, including insights into stock price trends and the model's predictive power. Provide recommendations for potential investors.

Tools and Libraries
For this project, we will use Python and various libraries, including:

Pandas for data manipulation.
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
Scikit-learn for building and evaluating the Random Forest Classifier model.
A reliable data source or API for fetching up-to-date stock price data.
Expected Deliverables
Python code in a Jupyter Notebook detailing the entire data analysis and modeling process.
Visualizations, including time series plots and model performance metrics.
A final report summarizing the project's objectives, methodology, findings, and recommendations.
Conclusion
This time series analysis project aims to provide insights into Apple Inc.'s historical stock price trends and develop a predictive model using a Random Forest Classifier. By the end of the project, we aim to make informed predictions about future stock prices, helping investors and stakeholders make data-driven decisions in the dynamic stock market environment.
